What The Hex? is a free and open-source colour picking tool, just like
the eyedrop tool in image editors such as GIMP. But unlike those
editors, What The Hex? is designed to provide you with the Hex or RGB
information you're looking for in the fastest way possible.  

![What The Hex?][1]

Instead of...

1. Pressing the PrintScreen key
2. Opening your image editor
3. Pasting in your image
4. Clicking the eyedrop tool

You can...

1. Open What The Hex?

What The Hex? automatically takes and displays a screenshot when opened,
allowing you to simply zoom and click to find a pixel's hex and RGB
information.
