##What's this, then?
What The Hex? is a simple colour picker tool that reduces the need for
taking screenshots and playing with image editors like Photoshop or
GIMP.  When launched, What The Hex? takes and displays a screenshot,
which you can click to get the desired RGB and Hex (HTML) information
from the desired pixel.

What The Hex? is free and open-source software.  The latest version of
the source code can be downloaded from
[GitHub](https://github.com/dHeinemann/What-The-Hex).  Precompiled
versoins with fancy installers can [also be downloaded
there](https://github.com/dHeinemann/What-The-Hex/downloads).

##Requirements
What The Hex? requires version 4.0 of the .Net framework.

##Future features
* Easier panning/scrolling of screenshot using right-click, the
  spacebar, or similar.

##License
What The Hex? is released under the MIT license.
